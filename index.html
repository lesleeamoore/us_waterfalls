			<p>With a drop that has been measured between 209 and 215 feet, Taughannock Falls has been named the tallest waterfall east of the Rocky Mountains.  The National Geographic Guide to State Parks for the United States tells us this is the case.  But there are many ways to measure a waterfall, according to the World Waterfall Database, thus the Taughannock Falls may or may not be the tallest in the eastern half of the United States.  Interestingly, there are 10 other waterfalls within five miles of Taughannock Falls, which is on the Taughannock Creek very near Cayuga Lake in the Finger Lakes region of New York state. </p>

			<p>A 2020 article in the Ithaca Journal newspaper written by David Wren explores the legends behind the name of the falls.  According to one legend, the name means 'great fall in the woods' and arises from the Irogquois and Algonquin language, even though the area was populated by the Cayuga Nation.  Scholars are doubt the verasity of this legend.  Another legend thought to be unlikely by scholars and academics, posits that a Lenape chief named Taughannock was killed in battle in the area. Archeologists studying the area and Cayuga history may eventually learn more; but, for now, as Wren writes, the story behind the name of the waterfall remains a  mystery.</p>

		<h3>Map details</h3>
		<p>This map was created for MAP671 at the University of Kentucky during the Fall 2023 semester by Leslee Moore using QGIS and Mapbox.  Waterfall and elevation data were downloaded from the U.S. Geological Survey and rendered in QGIS.  The projection used was NAD83 - EPSG: 4269 at a scale of 5000 feet.  Following rendering of a contours layer and identifying index lines, the waterfall data and contour layers were uploaded to Mapbox, where a zoomable map that includes more than 11000 waterfalls and is centered on the coordinates for Taughannock Falls, was produced.  Those coordinates are -76.610502, 42.535608.    </p>
